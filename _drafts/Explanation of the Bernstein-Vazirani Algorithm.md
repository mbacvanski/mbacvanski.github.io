# Explanation of the Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm

Here is the way of thinking about this algorithm that helped me understand how it works.

The Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm was one of the early algorithms discovered for quantum computers, and it demonstrated the superiority of a quantum computer over a classical computer in one specific problem. The Bernstein-Vazirani problem can be solved in $ O(1) $ on a quantum computer, while a classical computer can at best solve the problem in $ O(n) $.
