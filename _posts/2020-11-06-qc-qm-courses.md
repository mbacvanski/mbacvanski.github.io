Listing of quantum physics and quantum computing courses I found. Current as of November 2020.

Foundational QC Courses
-----------------------

##### [Quantum Computing. Less Formulas - More Understanding](https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantum-computing-lfmu?aid=true) Coursera (5 weeks)
-   Course by the same professor at St. Petersburg University who taught [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantum-computing-algorithms) (extremely math heavy, not a great experience for me). This course claims to focus "on how the mathematical model of quantum computing grows out from physics and experiment, while omitting most of the formulas (when possible) and rigorous proofs."
-   Begins with math of quantum computing, then math of quantum physics, then a bit of physics

##### [Purdue: Micro Master's in Quantum Computing](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/purduex-quantum-technology-computing) EDX (9 months, 7-9 hours per week, $4725)
-   Intro to quantum science & computation, QC fundamentals and present applications, hardware, algorithms & software, & quantum detectors
-   Instructor led: started August 2020, last section on quantum detectors starts February 2021. 
-   Sections like [this](https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-computing-i-fundamentals) or [this](https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-computing-iii-algorithm-and-software) starting in January and later, but very expensive

##### MIT: Quantum Information Science I EDX (archived, free / $49)
-   [Part one:](https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-information-science-i-part-1) physics of information processing, quantum logic & algorithms, error correction, communication & key distribution
-   [Part two: ](https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-information-science-i-part-2)quantum teleportation, superdense coding, Deutsch-Josza & Simon's algorithms, Grover's, Shor's.
-   [Part three:](https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-information-science-i-part-3) noise models, quantum channels, error correction, key distribution, quantum protocols

##### MIT: Quantum Information Science II EDX (archived, free / $49) -- Chuang, Harrow
*Assumes strong background in quantum mechanics.*

-   [Part one:](https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-information-science-ii-quantum-states-nois) Quantum states, noise and error correction -- density matrices and noisy quantum operations, and advanced quantum error correction codes.
-   [Part two:](https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-information-science-ii-efficient-quantum-c)  Fault tolerance & complexity -- fault-tolerant computation, quantum supremacy, quantum algorithms at scale. 
-   [Part three: ](https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-information-science-ii-advanced-quantum-al)Advanced algorithms & information theory -- Hamiltonian simulation, the hidden subgroup problem, linear systems, and noisy quantum channels. 

Quantum ML & Other Applications
-------------------------------

##### [University of Toronto: Quantum Machine Learning](https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-machine-learning) EDX (9 weeks, 6-8 hours/week, free / $49) -- Wittek

-   Quantum-enhanced machine learning, focusing on algorithms challenging to classical computers. Implement protocols using open-source tools in Python.
-   Describe and implement classical-quantum hybrid learning algorithms. Encode classical information in quantum systems. Perform discrete optimization in ensembles and unsupervised machine learning with different quantum computing paradigms. Sample quantum states for probabilistic models. Experiment with unusual kernel functions on quantum computers
-   Demonstrate coherent quantum machine learning protocols and estimate their resources requirements. Summarize quantum Fourier transformation, quantum phase estimation and quantum matrix, and implement these algorithms. General linear algebra subroutines by quantum algorithms. Gaussian processes on a quantum computer.

Quantum Mechanics
-----------------
##### [MIT: Quantum Mechanics: A First Course](https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-mechanics-a-first-course) EDX (18 weeks, 10-15 hours/week, free / $149)
-   Wavefunctions and their probabilistic interpretation, how to solve the Schrödinger equation for a particle moving in one-dimensional potentials, scattering, central potentials, and the hydrogen atom
-   Probably a good place to start, then do Mastering QM

##### [MIT: Quantum Mechanics: Wavefunctions, Operators, Expectation Values](https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-mechanics-wavefunctions-operators-and-expe) EDX (4 weeks, free / $49)
-   First in 3 courses, but this one seems most relevant
-   de Broglie waves, the wavefunction, and its probability interpretation. We then introduce the Schrodinger equation, inner products, and Hermitian operators. We also study the time-evolution of wave-packets, Ehrenfest's theorem, and uncertainty relations.

##### MIT: Mastering Quantum Mechanics EDX
*"Completing the 3-part Quantum Mechanics series will give you the necessary foundation to pursue advanced study or research at the graduate level in areas related to quantum mechanics."* Follows MIT's 8.05.

-   Part 1: [Wave Mechanics](https://www.edx.org/course/mastering-quantum-mechanics-part-1-wave-mechanics) (4 weeks, self-paced, free  / $50)
    -   Some knowledge of wave mechanics at undergrad introductory level required
    -   Basics of wave mechanics, variational principle, spin one-half states, spin operators, Dirac notations
    -   Must have seen Schrödinger's equation, solutions for square well potential, harmonic oscillator, hydrogen atom. Maybe one can get away without this because the course doesn't build on it.
-   Part 2: [Quantum Dynamics](https://www.edx.org/course/mastering-quantum-mechanics-part-2-quantum-dynamic) (5 weeks, 12-13 hours/week, free / $50)
-   Heisenberg's uncertainty, compatible operators, Schrödinger's and Heisenberg pictures, coherent & squeezed states of harmonic oscillator, two-state systems, NMR & masers.
-   Part 3: [Entanglement & Angular Momentum](https://www.edx.org/course/mastering-quantum-mechanics-part-3-entanglement-an) (5 weeks, 12-13 hours/week, free / $50
-   Tensor product states, entanglement, Bell inequalities, angular momentum, central potentials, hidden symmetries.
