I want to learn about ideas, and I want to use what I learn to create something new. I want to do research, to invent, to combine ideas, tear them apart, and create new ones of my own. I want to learn the ideas and innovations of those before me — I want to learn to think in the ways they did and in the ways they never did.

I want to learn about people — others, and myself. I want to learn the stories they tell, the lives they live, their hopes, their fears, their aspirations, the long journey from which they have come and the longer journey they have yet to go — and I hope to better understand those same things in my own life.
