**Hello! I'm Marc. I'm currently a student researcher at Google Quantum AI. I just completed my undergrad at Northeastern University, and I'll be starting my PhD at MIT this fall.**

I'm excited about computing with quantum technologies to do cool things new things in AI!

I love startups, dancing, reading, jazz, film photography, learning exciting things, and sharing that excitement with others.

## Currently

- 🏄‍♂️ Student researcher at Google Quantum AI, in Venice, CA!

## Recently

- 🎓 Graduated from Northeastern University!

- 📜 Submitted a preprint of my first research paper, about reconfiguration algorithms for large atom arrays! [Read it on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03885).

- 🥽 Software Intern at Meta Reality Labs! I worked on new features for [Horizon Worlds](https://www.oculus.com/horizon-worlds/), Meta's flagship Metaverse experience.

- ⚛️ Software intern at [QuEra Computing](https://www.quera.com/)! I built software for the full stack of a Rydberg array based quantum computer, ranging from low-level quantum controls to [Bloqade](https://github.com/QuEraComputing/Bloqade.jl), QuEra's high performance emulator for neutral atom quantum computing.

- 🤏 Research at the University of Waterloo's [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/), in the [Transformative Quantum Technologies](https://tqt.uwaterloo.ca/) group! I worked on atom arrangement algorithms for large Rydberg atom arrays.
