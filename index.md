**Hello! I'm Marc. I'm currently a student at Northeastern University, studying Computer Science in the Artificial Intelligence track.**

These days I am interested in quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and data and machine learning approaches. In the past, I have been deeply involved in full stack web and mobile development. 

I love startups, dancing, reading, jazz, film photography, learning exciting things, and sharing my excitement with others.

## Currently

-  📚 Attending my final year of classes at Northeastern University!

## Recently

- 📜 Submitted a preprint of my first research paper, about reconfiguration algorithms for large atom arrays! [Read it on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03885).
- 🥽 Software Intern at Meta Reality Labs! I worked on new features for [Horizon Worlds](https://www.oculus.com/horizon-worlds/), Meta's flagship Metaverse experience.
- ⚛️ Software intern at [QuEra Computing](https://www.quera.com/)! I built software for the full stack of a Rydberg array based quantum computer, ranging from low-level quantum controls to [Bloqade](https://github.com/QuEraComputing/Bloqade.jl), QuEra's high performance emulator for neutral atom quantum computing.
- 🤏 Research at the University of Waterloo's [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/), in the [Transformative Quantum Technologies](https://tqt.uwaterloo.ca/) group! I worked on atom arrangement algorithms for large Rydberg atom arrays.
- 👍 Intern at Facebook on the AI and Data Developer Experience team!

## Less Recently

- 🦾 Software engineering intern at [Vicarious Surgical](https://www.vicarioussurgical.com/)!
- 🔎 Venture analyst at Northeastern's [IDEA Venture Accelerator](https://www.northeastern.edu/idea/). I'm stepping away temporarily in 2021.
- 🏙 Founder and lead organizer of the [MVHacks Hackathon](https://mvhacks.io/)
