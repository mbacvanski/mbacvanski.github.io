**Hello! I'm Marc. I'm currently a student at Northeastern University, studying Computer Science in the Artificial Intelligence track.**

I am passionate about quantum computing and machine learning. In the past, I have been heavily involved in full stack web and mobile development. 
These days I am more interested in quantum computing, ML/DL, back-end development, and data science.

I love startups, case competitions, hip hop dance, photography, learning new things, and using what I learn to help others.
