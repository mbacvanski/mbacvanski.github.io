**Hello! I'm Marc. I'm currently a student at Northeastern University, studying Computer Science in the Artificial Intelligence track.**

In the past, I have been heavily involved in full stack web and mobile development. These days I am more interested in back-end development, data science, ML/DL, and quantum computing.

I love startups, case competitions, hip hop dance, photography, learning new things, and using what I learn to help others.
