**Hello! I'm Marc. I'm currently a student at Northeastern University, studying Computer Science in the Artificial Intelligence track.**

These days I am more interested in quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and data science/ML. In the past, I have been deeply involved in full stack web and mobile development. 

I love startups, case competitions, hip hop dance, jazz, learning to play the saxophone, film photography, learning exciting things, and sharing that excitement with others.
