**Hello! I'm Marc. I'm currently a student at Northeastern University, studying Computer Science in the Artificial Intelligence track.**

These days I am more interested in quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and data science/ML. In the past, I have been deeply involved in full stack web and mobile development. 

I love startups, case competitions, hip hop dance, jazz, learning to play the saxophone, film photography, learning exciting things, and sharing that excitement with others.

## Currently

- 👍 Intern at Facebook on the AI and Data Developer Experience team!
- 💻 VP of Technology Consulting at [Northeastern's TAMID chapter](https://www.nutamid.org/)
- 🎷 Learning to play the saxophone

## Recently

- 👨‍🔬 Developed atom arrangement algorithms for large Rydberg atom arrays! Did research at the University of Waterloo's Institute for Quantum Computing, in the [Transformative Quantum Technologies](https://tqt.uwaterloo.ca/) group.
- 🦾 Software engineering intern at [Vicarious Surgical](https://www.vicarioussurgical.com/)!
- 🔎 Venture analyst at Northeastern's [IDEA Venture Accelerator](https://www.northeastern.edu/idea/). I'm stepping away temporarily in 2021.
- ⚛️ Completed [CS-191x: Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/18fb330fda7e47ec834dafaa682a5a0b), a course from UC BerkeleyX taught by Prof. Umesh Vazirani. Topics included the Quantum Fourier Transform, Grover's algorithm, Shor's algorithm, Hamiltonians, Schrödinger's equation, and manipulating physical spin qubits.
- 🧠 Completed a [specialization in deep learning](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/UW7XJ2WBD4A2), where I learned how to build and apply deep neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and sequence models. 
- 🌐 Received a [certificate](/assets/QGSS_QuantumExcellenceCertificate.pdf) from IBM's Qiskit [Global Summer School](https://qiskit.org/events/summer-school/)! I learned to use Qiskit to run quantum algorithms on real quantum hardware.
- 🔥 Created an interactive [vibe alignment chart for Boston](/blog/vibe-of-boston)
- 📚 Attending classes at Northeastern University
- 👨‍💻 Lead software developer at [Deuce Technologies](https://deuce.technology/)
- 🏙 Founder and lead organizer of the [MVHacks Hackathon](https://mvhacks.io/)
