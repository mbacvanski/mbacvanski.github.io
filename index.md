Hello! I'm Marc. I'm currently a student at Northeastern University, studying Computer Science in the Artificial Intelligence track.

In the past, I have been heavily involved in full stack web and mobile development. These days I am more interested in back-end development, data science, ML/DL, and quantum computing.

I love startups, case competitions, hip hop dance, photography, learning new things, and using what I learn to help others.

## Currently

- 🦠Working with the [Coronavirus Visualization Team](https://scholar.harvard.edu/cvt/about) on data analysis for COVID-19
- 🔎Venture analyst at Northeastern's [IDEA Venture Accelerator](https://www.northeastern.edu/idea/)
- 🔥Creating an interactive [vibe alignment chart for Boston](https://mbacvanski.github.io/vibe-of-boston/) (work in progress!)
- 📚Attending classes at Northeastern University
- 🔬Studying quantum computing for fun
