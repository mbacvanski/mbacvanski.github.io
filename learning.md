# A few things I learn every day
_This isn't real-time. I usually update this every so often with a few days at once. Dates in `YYYY-MM-DD`._

### 2020-09-11
* What a [disjoint union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union) is
* The basics of [lambda calculus](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~gupta/courses/apl/lambda.pdf)
* How we can interpret [quantum circuits as higher order functions](https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/qlambdabook.pdf) (!!!)
* How to [add LaTeX equations to this blog](https://github.com/mbacvanski/mbacvanski.github.io/commit/4aaa8bc833425b62fd3952aa31ae7791f799b3db) so that you can see the lovely next bullet
* One can think of quantum state teleportation as $$ g(f(\vert\phi\rangle)) = \vert\phi\rangle $$, and its inverse of teleporting classical bits, as $$ f(g(x, y)) = (x,y) $$ when $$ f:qbit \rightarrow bit\; \otimes\; bit $$, $$ g:bit\;\otimes\;bit \rightarrow qbit $$. $$f$$ is located at the sender, while $$g$$ is located at the receiver (in state teleportation). ___Beautiful.___

### 2020-09-10
* Checkpointing and restart versus Kubernetes's approach to [drain a node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/safely-drain-node/)
* Mainframes still exist (!) and are still used today when huge amounts of memory needs to be accessed by huge amounts of processors, and for high throughput applications
* _"The computer is the tool, computation is the principle."_ (I kinda already knew this but this is a nice way of saying it)
* _“There are at least two kinds of games. One could be called finite, the other, infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.”_ (Finite and Infinite Games, Ballantine, 1986, p. 1.)

### 2020-09-09
* Who the AI research faculty are at Northeastern, what are the labs, and what they work on
* Living in a red haze all day from the wildfire smoke really messes with how you perceive time. I felt exactly like I feel at hackathons, since the luminosity of my room did not change from morning to evening.

### 2020-09-08
* [Lambda](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0404056.pdf) [calculus](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/S0097539703432165) [for](https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/qlambdabook.pdf) [quantum](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-89366-2_19.pdf) [computers](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/971/quantum-lambda-calculus) is insane and I need to learn more. Somehow I've managed to not hear about this before. It seems like an area orthogonal to the gate model and that is going to be super important once the hardware of quantum computing is ironed out.
* SecDB is a thing. More, I cannot really say

### 2020-09-07
* Dewey Square by Charlie Parker, on saxophone

### 2020-09-06 
* [Surprising effect](https://blog.janestreet.com/l2-regularization-and-batch-norm/) when you use both L2 Regularization and Batch Norm together

### 2020-09-05
* This [startup](https://replika.ai/) building an AI friend/therapist/romantic partner, and a [great podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AGPbvCDBCk) about it

### 2020-09-03
* How to set up a custom message to greet people on your SSH server

### 2020-09-02
* "Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won't come in." - Isaac Asimov
* Foothill College ran a course on quantum computing. [Here is the book](https://www.fgamedia.org/faculty/loceff/cs_courses/cs_83a/Intro_to_QC_Vol_1_Loceff.pdf), and [here are the lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMnoxczUtKqWpKZTwpRBHrif_y-xENTfx).
* The [right packages to remove](https://askubuntu.com/questions/73219/remove-packages-to-transform-desktop-to-server#) to transform a desktop linux image into a headless server 

### 2020-09-01
* More of Dewey Square
* Up until 1820, China was the world's largest economy, accounting for almost 33% of the world's GDP at the time ([source](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33534.html)).

### 2020-08-31
* The Raspberry Pi Zero is tinier than you expect and cuter than you expect
* How to play the first page of Dewey Square by Charlie Parker on the saxophone

### 2020-08-30
* How to use Go modules
* How to set up a compressed Docker image from a Go project
* I should look into [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) for building Kubernetes apps
