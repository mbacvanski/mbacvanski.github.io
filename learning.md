title: A Few Things I Learn Every Day
mathjax: true
---

I try to learn or discover something new every day. Here's a log of all the things that I get excited about!

I usually update this every so often with a few days at once. Dates in `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### 2019-09-26

* Github [refuses](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/katex-not-working-on-github-pages/4468/5) to use [KaTex](https://katex.org/) with Jekyll, switched over to just [mathjax](https://sgeos.github.io/github/jekyll/2016/08/21/adding_mathjax_to_a_jekyll_github_pages_blog.html).

### 2019-09-25

* How to solve the [closest pair problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest_pair_of_points_problem) in O(nlog(n)) time
* Cool [bit twiddling tricks](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html) and [crazy bit manipulations](http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/blog/?p=78)
* Classes and inheritance in C++
* Use the `title` attribute instead of `#h1` in this file to make sure the title doesn't appear twice. [Weird things happen](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1618#issuecomment-379807051) when you use the `#h1 ` thing.

### 2019-09-24

* Imposter syndrome (I might have it?)

### 2019-09-23

* How memory mapped IO works

### 2019-09-22

* How the [median of medians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_of_medians) algorithm works to produce the approximate median in $$O(n)$$ time
* How to [write a news article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2010/sep/24/1) about a scientific paper üôÉ

* After you add an ssh key to Github, you need to use the ssh url to clone the repo in order to use your ssh credentials.

### 2019-09-21

* How to use partially observable markov decision processes ([POMDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_observable_Markov_decision_process)) to efficiently search for items on a desk using a robotic manipulator, when some items obscure others. While solving for full solutions for a POMPD requires an $$O(n^2)$$ solution, using [Monte-Carlo sampling](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4031-monte-carlo-planning-in-large-pomdps.pdf) can cut this time down dramatically, enabling **[this paper](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/camato/publications/icra2019_1664.pdf)** to be able to plan movements of the robotic manipulator in real time. 
* In that paper, they use a POMDP by defining:
	* Set of world states (the objects on the table)
	* Set of actions (moving an object, moving the robot camera location/angle)
	* Set of observations (using R-CNN model to recognize bounding boxes for objects on the table)
	* State transition function, defining the probability distribution of new states after taking some action (moving an item) under the current state
	* Observation function, defining the probability distribution of possible observations (arrangements of obscured objects) given the resulting state and an action. Follows from the state transition function.
	* Reward function, giving a valued-reward for taking certain actions like finding the correct item.

* One can think of quantum state teleportation as $$ g(f(\vert\phi\rangle)) = \vert\phi\rangle $$, and its inverse of teleporting classical bits, as $$ f(g(x, y)) = (x,y) $$ when $$ f:qbit \rightarrow bit\; \otimes\; bit $$, $$ g:bit\;\otimes\;bit \rightarrow qbit $$. $$f$$ is located at the sender, while $$g$$ is located at the receiver (in state teleportation). ___Beautiful.___

* _"The computer is the tool, computation is the principle."_ (I kinda already knew this but this is a nice way of saying it)
* _‚ÄúThere are at least two kinds of games. One could be called finite, the other, infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.‚Äù_ (Finite and Infinite Games, Ballantine, 1986, p. 1.)

* Living in a red haze all day from the wildfire smoke really messes with how you perceive time. I felt exactly like I feel at hackathons, since the luminosity of my room did not change from morning to evening.

### 2020-09-08
* [Lambda](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0404056.pdf) [calculus](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/S0097539703432165) [for](https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/qlambdabook.pdf) [quantum](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-89366-2_19.pdf) [computers](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/971/quantum-lambda-calculus) is insane and I need to learn more. Somehow I've managed to not hear about this before. It seems like an area orthogonal to the gate model and that is going to be super important once the hardware of quantum computing is ironed out.
* SecDB is a thing. More, I cannot really say
