title: A Few Things I Learn Every Day
mathjax: true
---

I try to learn or discover something new every day. Here's a log of all the things that I get excited about!

I usually update this every so often with a few days at once. Dates in `YYYY-MM-DD`.

* Darwinism suggests that human altruism may have evolved in a way such that groups of early humans who demonstrated more altruism, were more likely to survive in violent conflicts against other groups with less altruistic traits. [This study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26268380_Did_Warfare_Among_Ancestral_Hunter-Gatherers_Affect_the_Evolution_of_Human_Social_Behaviors) suggests that [violence](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0126589) among [early humans](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16477) played a significant role in shaping the social dynamics of groups during the hunter-gatherer time period.

### 2019-09-21

* How to use partially observable markov decision processes ([POMDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_observable_Markov_decision_process)) to efficiently search for items on a desk using a robotic manipulator, when some items obscure others. While solving for full solutions for a POMPD requires an $$O(n^2)$$ solution, using [Monte-Carlo sampling](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4031-monte-carlo-planning-in-large-pomdps.pdf) can cut this time down dramatically, enabling **[this paper](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/camato/publications/icra2019_1664.pdf)** to be able to plan movements of the robotic manipulator in real time. 
* In that paper, they use a POMDP by defining:
	* Set of world states (the objects on the table)
	* Set of actions (moving an object, moving the robot camera location/angle)
	* Set of observations (using R-CNN model to recognize bounding boxes for objects on the table)
	* State transition function, defining the probability distribution of new states after taking some action (moving an item) under the current state
	* Observation function, defining the probability distribution of possible observations (arrangements of obscured objects) given the resulting state and an action. Follows from the state transition function.
	* Reward function, giving a valued-reward for taking certain actions like finding the correct item.

* One can think of quantum state teleportation as $$ g(f(\vert\phi\rangle)) = \vert\phi\rangle $$, and its inverse of teleporting classical bits, as $$ f(g(x, y)) = (x,y) $$ when $$ f:qbit \rightarrow bit\; \otimes\; bit $$, $$ g:bit\;\otimes\;bit \rightarrow qbit $$. $$f$$ is located at the sender, while $$g$$ is located at the receiver (in state teleportation). ___Beautiful.___
